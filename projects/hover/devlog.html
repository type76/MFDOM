	<p>TL:DR.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Put it in the render loop</li>
	<li>Don't move it, affect it</li>
	<li>Lerp more</li>

	<h2 id="cb"  onclick="typeme(this)">Start game</h2>


	<p>In a game dev discord channel one day, duneworld jeff told me this: 
	</p>

	<p class="quote">"I heard of this community project called "Branching Corpses", where the idea is that people in the community develop games over 2-3 days (no longer than a week, and not with an extreme effort like a jam) that are based off one of the endings of a previously developed game in the project." 
	</p>

	<p>I checked the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">wikipedia page</a> on Exquisite Corpses and realised that I just learned the name of something I loved and never knew the name of. This is that monster drawing game. Someone draws the head, folds it, next person draws a body, folds it, last person does the legs and we did a monster.</p>

	<h2 id="cb"  onclick="typeme(this)">A Corpse Was Born</h2>

	<p>I decided to adapt a previous <a href="https://type76.com/projects/drive/" title="driving experiment">experiment</a> as a game for this project. I needed to make another control system, add some objects to collide with, a win/lose scenario and make a 'world' for it to live in. With a bare concept, no actual plan and never having made a game before, I joined the group, asked nicely and got the all clear.</p>

	<p>The rules are <a href="https://branching-corpses.fandom.com/wiki/Branching_Corpses_Wiki">here</a>. I also set my own rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>make an arcade style racer</li>
<li>use only three.js</li>
<li>all code is in <a href="https://github.com/type76/type76.github.io/blob/master/projects/hover/index.html">one file</a></li>
<li>keep size under 2mb</li>
<li>don't draw</li>
</ul>

	<p>
	All code is contained in one file to keep development quick and dirty. The code isn't optimal. Nor is the font you are looking at. Let me know if you have suggestions. I'll try to do a devlog without any code and explain these concepts in general. Things here will apply to other development and creative work regardless of the software/engine/language.</p>

	<h2 id="xth"  onclick="typeme(this)">Three.js</h2>
	<p><a href="https://threejs.org">Three.js</a> is a 3D library that makes 3D easy to render 'real time' in the browser with javascript. Even on mobile, it runs perfectly. Its hard to explain the possibilities of this thing. It combines my loves of art, interaction and animation in one file. It has me as excited as flash did in the past. The best way of learning it is to play with the code in the <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/?q=ray"> examples</a>.</p>

	<p>Three.js has at it's heart a render loop (requestAnimationFrame). This is a function that plays (or renders) once every frame or tick. Maximum is 60fps for a browser, but you can tick at any speed. This is where the magic happens.</p>

	<p>If we play to three.js strengths, we get good results. Being economical with things helps. We should use few items, re-use and not destroy the things we make. Here, every rock is the same rock, just rotated, positioned and scaled differently.</p>

	<h2 id="xc" onclick="typeme(this)">Raycasting</h2>
	<p>This is a ray that is cast inside the 3D world that gives you information on its collisions. With that information, you can do things. The mouse and ship have rays. The control plane, rocks, bonus and penalties are colliders. Here is an <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/control-ray.html"> example</a>.</p>

	<p>Here the 2D screen mouse position is obtained first. A ray is sent from the browser x and y positions, from the camera lens and into the scene. When the ray hits the ground plane (collider), those x, y and z positions are used. An object can be sent to that ray end point every mouse move and now we have a cursor in 3D space. Pixel perfect 2D to 3D collision detection with very little code. [line 636]</p>


	<h2 id="lrp"  onclick="typeme(this)">The Lerp</h2>

	<p>The mouse position is too fast and jerky and I attemted many ways to smooth it. I had known of the technique of <a href="https://lunarlabs.pt/blog/post/the-art-of-lerp">linear interpolation</a> (or Lerp) from one value to another by manually tweening values in an algorithm fixed to time. An algorithm that had fame even. This was a perfect case and when I tried, it fit. To achieve this I have a 3D cursor and ship object. The ship always lerps to the cursors position, so we have this delayed follow movement. Not moving the thing directly, but changing conditions that affect the thing. Like moving a magnet under a surface to control a ball bearing. Here's a bare bones working <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/lerp.html">example</a> with a box that rotates nicely.</p>


	<h2 id="ctr"  onclick="typeme(this)">2D and 3D Control</h2>
	<p>In my plan, I had the control plane flip from laying on the ground horizontal to being vertical in your face. Dynamic! This happened in a nice fluid motion when the spacebar is pressed. I wanted it to be part of the game. You drive, then you fly. Here's an <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/index2.html">example</a>. In re-assesing priorities, I decided to not do the mechanic as something the player controls as it brought complications and it's not simple for a simple game. It's a lot of fun though.</p>

	<p>There was an older user interface then too. A little svg keyboard in the corner. I liked that and may use the technique again in future. Also too complex for this project.</p>


	<h2 id="rev"  onclick="typeme(this)">The Revcounter</h2>

	<p>A go faster button is easy right? The accelerator was on/off in the very early days of this concept. You press go and it goes to that speed immediately with no gradual acceleration. Obviously not good. I wanted a nice gradual speed increase on press and gradual decrease to zero on press down. This should also be linked to time and therefore be in the render loop. This took ages, but I found the solution in a combination of solutions: <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/press-timer.html">press-timer</a> and <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/press-hold.html">press-hold</a>. One going up and one going down. That complicated little series of variable changes and loops make it behave like it has weight. It's still not perfect, but it works and feels right as is. I hook other things to this speed variable to drive the game, like the engine sound and background movement. I'm sure this acceleration system can be re-used in other projects and I hope you make use of it too. Works in all javascript situations, not just three.js.</p>


	<h2 id="xst"  onclick="typeme(this)">The story</h2>

	<p>I'm trying not to draw at all in the making of this, so I found a nice <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-male-base-mesh-7b9411ff0c624321baf4caac014bc0bd">low poly base model</a> (credit: decodigo), pushed some polygons in lightwave 3D and made <a href="https://type76.com/projects/hover/guys.html">this</a>.</p>

	<p>This scene portrays the heroes of our story, waiting for the ships computer to finish it's program. I originally made Claus a kid and G'naike a muscle man. Thanks Adrien for the fixes in keeping continuity there.</p>


	<h2 id="xc" onclick="typeme(this)">Lessons Learned</h2>
		<p>The solution to many problems runs <b>inside the render loop</b>. It might be because it introduces the <b>time</b> variable that became the big hook to hang everything from. The other lesson was in using affectors and lerp.</p>
